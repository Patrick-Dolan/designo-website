## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address`, or `Your Message`` fields are empty and should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Tooling

### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned during this project was when to choose grid over flexbox for layouts. I initially used Flexbox for the project cards, and the links layout, but the more advanced the layout became, the clearer it became that the grid was a better tool for the job.

### Continued development
In future projects, I want to practice using composition more. I think my implementation of the `Container` component was a solid concept but I didn't execute it as well as I wanted. 

I also plan to look into how other developers are using Tailwind for responsive design. This is my second project using the framework, and I've done some research on best practices, but I think it's time for some further exploration.
